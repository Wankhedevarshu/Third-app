      <div className='container'>The Marmadukeâ€“Walker duel was fought between John S. Marmaduke (pictured) and 
      Lucius M. Walker, two generals in the Confederate States Army, on September 
      6, 1863, near Little Rock, Arkansas. Tensions had risen between the two officers during the Battle of 
      Helena on July 4, 1863, when Marmaduke accused Walker of not supporting his force, then retaliated by 
      not informing Walker of a Confederate retreat. Marmaduke was later assigned to serve under Walker 
      during a Union advance against Little Rock. Walker did not support Marmaduke during a retreat after 
      the Battle of Brownsville. After the Battle of Bayou Meto on August 27, Marmaduke questioned 
      Walker's courage. A series of notes passed between the two generals by friends resulted in a duel, 
      during which Walker received a fatal wound. Marmaduke was arrested, but later released; he 
      survived the war and later became Governor of Missouri. Union forces captured Little Rock later in the 
      campaign, after the Battle of Bayou Fourche. (Full article...)</div>
